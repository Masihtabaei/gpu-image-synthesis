# Coburg Mesh And Scene Viewers

> [!NOTE]  
> This project was completed as part of the **GPU Image Synthesis** course during the **Winter Term 2024/25** of our undergraduate studies, offered by [Prof. Dr. Quirin Meyer](https://www.hs-coburg.de/en/personen/prof-dr-quirin-meyer/) at [Coburg University](https://www.hs-coburg.de/en/). It was originally developed on our universityâ€™s GitLab instance and later partially migrated here, so some elements like issues may be missing.

## General Information

Sueprvisors: [Prof. Dr. Quirin Meyer](https://www.hs-coburg.de/en/personen/prof-dr-quirin-meyer/) and [Bastian Kuth](https://bloodwyn.github.io/#CV_Bastian_Kuth.pdf)

Here you will find both Coburg mesh and scene viewer projects.

The Coburg mesh viewer is capabale of:
- Loading a mesh stored in the Cogra binary format
- Applying a wireframe overly
- Applying lighting
- Applying shading (both flat and smooth)
- Applying a texture

In this project, simple vertex and pixel shaders were implemented.

The Coburg scene viewer is capable of:
- Loading a glTF scene
- Applying a wireframe overly
- Drawing axis-aligned bounding boxes
- Applying lighting
- Applying shading (both flat and smooth)
- Applying a texture

In addition to vertex and pixel shaders, we had also a simple compute shader to calculate axis-aligned bounding boxes on the GPU.


## Usage

```bash
git clone <repo-link>
cd first-assignment # or second-assignment
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg.cmake-file-path> ..
```

After generating the solution, you can open it and select and run the project desired.
